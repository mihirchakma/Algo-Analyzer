# Algorithm Analyzer

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is for *CIT300 Graded Practical Assignment 3* (Week 14). The objective is to develop a standard Java application to measure and analyze the runtime performance (algorithmic complexity) of four fundamental algorithms across different input sizes (100, 500, and 1000 elements).

We used ```System.nanoTime()``` instead of ```System.currentTimeMillis()``` because for small array sizes (100, 500), modern computers are too fast for milliseconds to register meaningful differences.

## ⏱️ Why We Use System.nanoTime()

For this assignment, we utilize System.nanoTime() instead of System.currentTimeMillis().

- **The Problem:** Modern computers are incredibly fast. Efficient algorithms like Binary Search or Quick Sort can process 1000 elements in less than 1 millisecond. Using ```System.currentTimeMillis()``` often results in a time of 0 ms, which provides no useful data for analysis.
- **The Solution:** ```System.nanoTime()``` provides nanosecond precision (1 millisecond = 1,000,000 nanoseconds). capturing highly accurate execution times. We then convert these nanoseconds back to milliseconds with decimal precision for the final output.

## 👥 Team Role Distribution

Per the assignment requirements, our team divided the implementation tasks as follows:

Member Algorithm Specific TaskMember 1Linear SearchMeasure time to find an element (worst-case scenario).Member 2Binary SearchSort the array first, then measure only the search time.Member 3Bubble SortMeasure full sorting time.Member 4Quick SortMeasure full sorting time.


| Member                     | Algorithm     | Specific Task                                            |
|:---------------------------|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Member 1** - 22UG3-0108  | Linear Search | Measure time to find an element (worst-case scenario).   |
| **Member 2** - 22UG3-0570  | Binary Search | Sort the array first, then measure only the search time. |
| **Member 3** - 22UG3-0912  | Bubble Sort   | Measure full sorting time.                               |
| **Member 4** - 22UG3-0235  | Quick Sort    | Measure full sorting time.                               |

## 📊 Sample Output

Below is an example of the output generated by our ```QuickSort``` implementation using nanosecond precision, converted to milliseconds for readability (e.g., ```Time / 1_000_000.0```).

```
========================================
Algorithm: Quick Sort
========================================
Input Size      | Time (ms)      
----------------------------------------
100             | 0.1664         
500             | 0.1944         
1000            | 0.2187         
========================================
```

(Note: Times of 0 ms indicate the algorithm executed in less than 1 millisecond. For more precise measurements on small inputs, consider switching to *System.nanoTime()* in the code.)
